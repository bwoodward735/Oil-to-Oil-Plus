# Oil-to-Oil-Plus

A mod for The Long Dark which allows cooking oil to be converted into lamp fuel by mixing it with accelerant. Uses 1 Accelerant and 1L of Cooking Oil to make 1L (2 cans) of Lamp Fuel. Takes 30 minutes and can be done anywhere.

Also includes torch recipes using cooking oil (one torch, or a bundle of 6) and raw animal fat. Cooking oil torch requires 0.15L of cooking oil per torch, or 6 torches for 0.75L in the bundle. Animal fat torch uses 0.20kg of animal fat, and takes 20 minutes to craft.

### Mod requires ModComponent.

## Installation
Drop the modcomponent file into Mods.

## Future Plans
* Having crafted lamp fuel move into existing containers, instead of just making 2 cans.
